## Introduction
The vehicle monitoring is one of the major feature of  project.
In this technology it is used to determine the presence of the passanger
and if the passanger exist then our system starts the functionality.

So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new 
products to made the life easier.

In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of 
monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.
