# Requirements
## Introduction
In a vehicle there are many features available but specifically we are focusing on the Temperature monotoring of the seats.So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.

The main objective is to make and design a system which can sense the temp of the seats.
In this technology it is used to determine the presence of the passanger
and if the passanger exist then our system starts the functionality.


## Features
- It is  capable of determining weather the user is exist or not in the vehicle.
- If Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication.
- After the indication it will determine the heat of the seat.
- Driver and the passanger will have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
- The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system



## SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats
### Strengths monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.
-It is not suitable for average or high temperature environment.

# 4W's and 1'H
- **WHAT** : Passanger Seat and Heat Monitoring System.
- **WHERE** : Used in automotive industry.
- **WHEN** : At low temperature.
- **WHY** : For more confort.
- **HOW** : Operates by modifying the temperature.
